If not contact the developer [in Discord ch3fh3tz#0964]
## Another Minecraft Bot 
Based on experiences i did with the [world border travel bot] to reach worlborder on 2B2t i decided to rework it
to allow Auto TPA to extraordinary places.


Freatures 
* TPA: Accept TPA request if player is not on ban list
* V1 Bots can be used with any Hack Client

Conversation 
* !where: to get the potential position of the bot
* !id: get more information about the bot

## Active Bots 

| SERVER | NAME | LOCATAION | FEATURES | STATISTICS | Active since |
| ------ | ------ |------ |------ |------ |------ |
| 0B0T.org | Ch3f_bot_01 | Worldborder +x | TPA | https://bit.ly/3yxdE2x Total TPA: 1521 Total Kill: 520|10.07.2021|

## Tech
The V1 bots are based on [Impact with Bariton] and a python script.
Statistics are collected from a [InfluxDB] cloud storage and visualized for the pulic with [Grafana].

## Bans
Some Players are already banned from service. This potentially happens when players killing a bot and the developer observed it.
So there is always a chance getting banned, be kind to the bots. Contact the developer [in Discord ch3fh3tz#0964] if you feel your ban was not reasonable.
